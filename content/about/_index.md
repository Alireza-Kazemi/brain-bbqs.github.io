The Brain Behavior Quantification and Synchronization (BBQS) program is a basic research effort to develop new tools and approaches in support of a more comprehensive mechanistic understanding of the neural basis of behavior.

{{< ytube UrvmYz41wsA >}}

## Goals

The goals of the BBQS program are to:

- Develop tools for simultaneous, multimodal measurement of behavior within complex, dynamic physical and/or social environments and synchronize these data with simultaneously recorded neural activity.
- Develop novel conceptual and computational models that capture dynamic behavior-environment relationships across multiple timescales and  integrate correlated neural activity into the model.
- Establish a cross-disciplinary consortium of researchers supported by a BBQS data coordination and artificial intelligence center.
- Develop and disseminate new tools, ontologies, research designs, data archives, informatics tools, data standards, and ethical frameworks that will transform how mechanistic brain-behavioral research is conducted.
