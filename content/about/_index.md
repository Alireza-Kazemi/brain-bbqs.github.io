The Brain Behavior Quantification and Synchronization (BBQS) program is a basic research effort to develop new tools and approaches in support of a more comprehensive mechanistic understanding of the neural basis of behavior.

## Goals

The goals of the BBQS program are to:

- Develop tools for simultaneous, multimodal measurement of behavior within complex, dynamic physical and/or social environments and synchronize these data with simultaneously recorded neural activity.
- Develop novel conceptual and computational models that capture dynamic behavior-environment relationships across multiple timescales and  integrate correlated neural activity into the model.
- Establish a cross-disciplinary consortium of researchers supported by a BBQS data coordination and artificial intelligence center.
- Develop and disseminate new tools, ontologies, research designs, data archives, informatics tools, data standards, and ethical frameworks that will transform how mechanistic brain-behavioral research is conducted.

<!-- ## What we offer

ReproNim offers a variety of resources to educate and enable individual researchers, imaging centers, and students.  Our resources address both conceptual and practical fundamentals of reproducible neuroimaging, why it is important, and how to do it through principles, tools, and training.

## ReproNim/INCF Fellows
 
The [ReproNim/INCF Fellowship](/fellowship/) is a full year, project-based train-the-trainer program with access to networking and mentorship.  It supports Fellows' training program development endeavors, which are tailored to their respective target audiences, training objectives, and local environs.

[ReproNim/INCF Fellows](/fellowship/#2024-awardees) (33 graduates, and 12 current fellows) are an important extension of ReproNim, with international representation and educational reach to highly varied audiences encompassing all career stages and diverse resources. 

The program is open by competitive review to applicants at all career stages.
