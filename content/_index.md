## Vision

To gain a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of the neural basis of behavior

## Mission

- Developing tools to capture and quantify behavior with high temporal resolution and across multiple dimensions
- Synchronizing with simultaneously recorded brain activity
- Building new conceptual and computational models that capture the complexity of behavior
- Establishing a cross-disciplinary consortium to develop, integrate, and disseminate tools, research designs, and ethical frameworks
