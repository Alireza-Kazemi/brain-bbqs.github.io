#### Purpose

The Working Group on Data Standards aims to establish and promote the adoption of data standards for novel sensors and multimodal data integration within the BBQS community. This effort is essential to facilitate FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) sharing and reuse of brain behavior data, ensuring consistency, interoperability, and integration of data and metadata to support scientific research and collaboration.

#### Deliverables

**1. Inventory Behavior Data Standards**
to enable the BBQS community to effectively leverage and use existing standards, ontologies, methods and tools:
- **Goal**: Identify and review existing data standards relevant to BBQS studies. Summarize and evaluate BBQS relevant data standards to understand their applicability and gaps. 
- **Deliverable**: Publish an organized and categorized catalog of standards for BBQS studies accessible via the BBQS web portal.
- **Stretch goal**: Engage with the relevant data standards to promote enhancements to address relevant gaps. 

**2. Develop Guidelines and Best Practices**
to help BBQS users understand which standards are relevant to their research and how to best use them, by:
- Identifying where 'fault lines' lie between standards to clarify which standards are most appropriate for what types of data and developing recommendations to clarify which standard(s) are best suited for BBQS.
- Formulating use-case driven minimum information (MI) requirement guidelines for BBQS data.

**3. Coordinate and Promote Enhancement of Standards**
to promote improvement of existing data standards to better meet BBQS needs by:
- Facilitating the organization of community working groups to develop strategies and enhancements to standards.
- Collaborating with standards bodies to update standards for BBQS and ensure compliance with neuroethics principles.
- Creating crosswalks to identify common metadata fields across standards and link them to existing ontologies.

**4. Facilitate Adoption and Use of BBQS Standards**
by working with BBQS and data standards bodies and teams to: 
- Create online tutorials and best practices to train BBQS teams in applying guidelines and best practices.
- Develop curated controlled term sets for BBQS, leveraging existing ontologies and resources.
- Develop mechanisms for annotating existing data standards to ease the adoption of BBQS data guidelines.
