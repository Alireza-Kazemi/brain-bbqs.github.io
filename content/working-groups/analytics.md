#### Purpose

The Working Group on Data Analytics and AI aims to establish and promote the sharing, refinement, and adoption of analytics and AI standards for novel sensors and multimodal data integration within the BBQS community. Specifically, the Working Group will strive towards achieving FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) sharing and reuse of AI and analytics derived results from brain-behavior data.

#### Deliverables

To achieve this overarching goal of ensuring FAIR standards for data and models across not only BBQS research consortium but also the broader community, the Working Group will: 
  * evaluate and curate relevant ML/AI models and platforms, 
  * assist with aggregating datasets, models, and other ML/AI resources from both within and outside the BBQS consortium.
